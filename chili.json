you want a good, basic chili recipe, this is it. No odd vegetables, or secret ingredients, just ground beef, tomatoes, red kidney beans, and the usual spices. Simple and delicious.&#34;","1":"&#34;This is my version of Chicken Chili, it was kinda thrown together for work and EVERYONE loved it.&#34;","2":"&#34;It is a chili...tomato base soup...without beans.  It is a soup that my family enjoys a great deal.  A variety of meats work in this soup, such as turkey, beef, or deer meat.  Can also top with shredded cheddar cheese when serving. Garnish with parsley.&#34;","3":"&#34;Quick, easy, yummy chili from Texas.&#34;","4":"&#34;This hot, spicy, complex New Mexico-style buffalo, chorizo, and pork chili will have you howling like a desert coyote. The meat marinates in dry seasoning overnight, so you'll need to plan ahead.&#34;","5":"&#34;This is a great healthy and easy-to-make chili, made famous at Firehouse Station No. 2 in Madison, Wisconsin. Serve with corn bread johnny-cakes.&#34;","6":"&#34;Absolutely delicious. I know it doesn't sound appetizing, but it's unbelievable how tasty it is, and so easy too!&#34;","7":"&#34;This is a very good chili made with pineapple for sweetness. Since this is a large recipe, you might want to go half-batch if this is just for a small family.&#34;","8":"&#34;A hearty venison chili made with tomatoes, onion and beans. Tequila gives it a boost of flavor. Adjust the spices to your taste.&#34;","9":"&#34;Southwestern style chili with chipotle peppers and beef.

It is also good over pasta.&#34;","18":"&#34;This was given to me by a good friend. My daughter had eaten it at my friend's house and came home raving about it! So I had to try it.

Then tame the spicy hotness with a cool lime crema topped with juicy chopped mango.&#34;","32":"&#34;This spicy chili recipe uses ground buffalo.

The mix of sweet and spicy will amaze your taste buds!&#34;","34":"&#34;This is a simple recipe for Texas chili I learned from my mother. I like my chili with a little fire to it, but you can adjust this recipe to your liking. This is a chili that only gets better the second day so don't worry about using a large pot and having more than your family can eat the first night because you can have it a couple of nights later. ENJOY. I know I do every time I make this chili.&#34;","35":"&#34;This chili is SO easy to make. You can pretty much throw whatever you have into the pot and it'll be great. (I added some leftover salsa once.) It's very colorful, not to mention delicious.&#34;","36":"&#34;I love this chili. I hope you love it as much as me.

Pair with honey cornbread and call 'come and get it!'&#34;","41":"&#34;You're not going to believe how awesome this chili tastes and how easy it is to make. I make batches and take it to work for lunch for the week. It's really filling and very healthy. You can substitute the chili beans with kidney beans if you wish, but be sure to drain them if you do. It's even better the next day, and if you omit the optional cheese, it's vegan-friendly!&#34;","42":"&#34;Quick, easy cool-weather vegan chili.&#34;","43":"&#34;This is my family's favorite chili . Serve over rice and sprinkle with shredded Monterey jack or Cheddar and a basket of tortilla chips for a great meal!

This well-seasoned chili warms you all over.&#34;","47":"&#34;I have made this dish for a group of 40. Made sure I did not tell them it was turkey until they asked for the recipe. Everyone could not believe it was turkey. Everyone wants me to make it again. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese alongside Spanish rice and tortilla chips.&#34;","48":"&#34;This chili is just right for the bold and the timid. It has some heat, but not too much for everyone to enjoy.&#34;","49":"&#34;This chili verde was one of the first recipes I ever learned. It comes out great even if you don't brown the meat, but I think doing so always adds extra flavor so I usually do it.&#34;","50":"&#34;This not-too-spicy chili with Italian sausage, cannellini beans, and tomatoes with garlic is ready to ladle up in less than  30 minutes.&#34;","51":"&#34;I LOVE to create new recipes.

It's perfect served with corn bread and salad.&#34;","52":"&#34;I won a blind taste test chili cookoff with this chili against nine traditional beef chilis! Garnish with shredded Tex-Mex cheese, crushed corn chips, and sour cream.&#34;","53":"&#34;This is one of my weekly meals for my family! It's easy and delicious. Top with sour cream, Cheddar cheese, chopped onion, green onion, or crushed tortilla chips. Maybe even in a sourdough bread bowl!&#34;","54":"&#34;Have you ever had grilled chili? Think it sounds wicked? Well, you're right! This chili will keep your mouth on fire and howling at the moon...&#34;","55":"&#34;Wicked easy and wicked good!&#34;","56":"&#34;I won first place 3 times with this recipe, and gave the recipe to a friend and he won first place with it also.&#34;","57":"&#34;Spicy sausage is browned, then cooked in a slow cooker with olives, tomato sauce and beans in this easy chili flavored with soy sauce.&#34;","58":"&#34;Ground beef and kidney beans are seasoned with garlic, oregano, cumin, and chili powder to make a chili that's packed with flavor.&#34;","59":"&#34;A traditional style chili that can be made with ground turkey or ground beef. I have made this recipe with ground beef and ground turkey, and they both have a similar flavor. Delicious with sweet corn bread and shredded Cheddar cheese. After the initial cooking on the stove, you can easily transfer this to a slow cooker.&#34;","60":"&#34;This is one of the most filling and hearty chili recipes you could ever make.&#34;","61":"&#34;A slow cooker recipe for white chicken chili assembled quickly with chicken thighs, canned beans and zesty tomatoes.&#34;","62":"&#34;Turn Zatarain's Black Beans and Rice Mix into a one-skillet chili meal that the whole gang will love.

(It's great if you like tomatoes too!)&#34;","64":"&#34;Venison chili is a big hit our house during the holidays and football season!&#34;","65":"&#34;This is an easy chili recipe that you can throw in the slow cooker and forget about all day. Great topped with Cheddar cheese, crushed corn chips, and a dollop of sour cream.&#34;","66":"&#34;Hot chili is a very underrated summer menu item. Bring a big ol' thermos of this to a picnic or other warm weather cookout, and it makes a great side to those grilled burgers and dogs. Just have some insulated cups around, and maybe some hot sauce, and you're in business. But no matter what season it is, I hope you give this beef, bean, and beer chili a try soon.&#34;","67":"&#34;Delicious white bean chili. Cha Cha says: 'It's kinda spicy, so watch out!' Substitute mild green chiles for the jalapenos if you're scared! Use more chicken and cheese as desired.&#34;","68":"&#34;Many of my Texan friends doubted a Canadian could make decent chili.

Use extra chili powder for an extra kick of spice.&#34;","73":"&#34;It just doesn't get any easier or more delicious than this! Saut\u00e9ed ground beef, onion, beans and Mexican style tomato soup simmer together to make a quick and hearty chili that everyone will love.&#34;","74":"&#34;An easy chili that's sure to please. I've made this for a Halloween party and a chili cook-off at work with great results!  It's a great base with lots of options to spice it up depending on the crowd you're cooking for! I usually put everything together in the morning and let it simmer all day; cooking time can be adjusted to fit your needs.&#34;","75":"&#34;Steaming, succulent and savory. A robust and hearty classic that never goes out of style.&#34;","76":"&#34;Savory, smoky, easy-to-make chili. Sometimes I add a can of corn, too. Maybe have some sweet corn bread muffins with honey on the side. You could use black beans, pinto beans, pink beans, or small red beans in place of the kidney beans.&#34;","77":"&#34;After years of adjustments I have found a recipe for all to enjoy. Previous ones were either too hot or too mild, this one even was to the liking of my fiance who hates chili.&#34;","78":"&#34;This recipe was given to me by a friend at work, who is an avid deer hunter. It's very different, but delicious! You would never know you're eating venison.&#34;","79":"&#34;This chili has always been great during football season--and the rest of the year! But I like to make it a little healthier by reducing the fat and sodium content. Sprinkle with red onion, cilantro or diced avocado (optional).&#34;","80":"&#34;This is a very hearty and tasty chili.&#34;","81":"&#34;This is a recipe we use for the Sioux Center Christian School soup supper. It is designed to be easy and  relatively inexpensive.&#34;","82":"&#34;This is a big pot of chili, great for when you have company; or you can freeze half and serve it again on a cold night when you don't feel like cooking. This is not too spicy for my young kids but flavorful enough to please the adults.&#34;","83":"&#34;This recipe came about when I tried to make a cabbage soup similar to the one served at a local restaurant. It is now a family favorite. I make it in a large quantity to share and to freeze.&#34;","84":"&#34;The cumin's the king here. I used to make this stuff during college because there is enough of it to last me a long time. This recipe is VERY hot.&#34;","85":"&#34;I altered a combination of two different recipes to come up with this chili. It's kind of like a mild green chili that's white with beans.&#34;","86":"&#34;Great tasting chili that doesn't take all day, but tastes like it did. Preparation time is about 2 hours. Best served over johnny cakes or corn chips.&#34;","87":"&#34;I just came up with this one day playing around in the kitchen. It's become a ranch favorite.

Serve topped with fresh cilantro, green onion, shredded Cheddar cheese, and light sour cream on top with cornbread on the side.\n&#34;","92":"&#34;Beans, greens and chicken come together with tomatoes in a thick and creamy broth. This recipe, as with most chili recipes, doesn't need to be exact and can be altered to fit your taste or what you have on hand. The choice of greens is up to you - my first choice is kale, but you can use spinach, turnip greens, collards or a combination (my favorite)!  If you use fresh greens, wash and chop them very fine before adding them to the slow cooker.&#34;","93":"&#34;When you have a craving for a hot bowl of chili but don't have lots of time, this recipe is hearty, delicious and fast.&#34;","94":"&#34;When I cook, I usually just throw stuff together and there it is.

It receives rave reviews from everyone.&#34;","99":"&#34;This is a thick, spicy, slow-cooked chili I adapted from another recipe. It's great for parties or cold nights! Serve topped with shredded Cheddar cheese or crumbled cornbread.&#34;","100":"&#34;This is the tastiest, easiest chili recipe you'll ever find. I recommend serving it with sliced jalapeno chile peppers and crackers or cornbread.&#34;","101":"&#34;This is a wonderful dish for cold winter days that really fills you up! My mother used to make this for my family, and it quickly became a favorite. This isn't your normal 'hot' chili and it's a great change of pace. It's best when served with buttered saltine crackers. This chili also freezes well.&#34;","102":"&#34;For a quick week-night meal, this chili--with sausage, kidney beans, corn, and just the right kick--can't be beat.&#34;","103":"&#34;Spicy delicious slow cooker chili -- serve with sweet corn bread.&#34;","104":"&#34;Family favorite. Quick and easy.&#34;","105":"&#34;I received this recipe from my sister-in-law's friend and she is from Poland. It has fresh chilies and tomatoes, along with beef and polish sausage. This is a really good, different chili recipe.&#34;","106":"&#34;This is a wonderful vegetarian recipe from the Cornucopia Restaurant which was in South Bend, IN.  It makes a very large pot of chili.  Freeze leftovers for a future meal, or cut ingredients in half for a normal pot of chili.&#34;","107":"&#34;This spooky chili is great for Halloween dinner! Keep warm on the stove and the little ones can eat anytime during trick-or-treat activities.&#34;","108":"&#34;Chili gets a makeover with Italian sausage, Crushed and Diced Tomatoes, black beans and sweet potatoes.

Came out great and every judge and taster enjoyed it. It will have the authentic chili flavor with a little 'twist.' This recipe should be started the night before you wish to serve it.&#34;","111":"&#34;I've added pork to ground beef in chili before, but I've never tried it with all Italian sausage, and I loved the results. We Italian'd this up even more with cannellini beans and a touch of basil, but other than that, it's a fairly classic chili. Garnish with sour cream, avocado, red onion, and basil.&#34;","112":"&#34;Not for the health conscious, but a huge hit with the men in my family while watching football on Sundays. Even better with onions and peppers, but this is the tried-and-true version. Enjoy!&#34;","113":"&#34;After trying several clone recipes and adjusting them to my tastes, I've concocted what I think is the best clone. Serve topped with finely diced white onions and\/or shredded cheese.

It's a brown chili not a red one - no tomatoes.&#34;","116":"&#34;This is a wonderful quick recipe that is hearty and filling! This recipe can easily be modified.

You can also add water to make it more of a soup.&#34;","117":"&#34;White chili is so good.&#34;","118":"&#34;This is the best and easiest chili I have ever had.  I make it often and if there are any leftovers I freeze some to pull out for a cold winter day.&#34;","119":"&#34;This delicious chili took 2nd place at our local chili cook-off!  Bet you can't eat just one bowl.  If it is too thick, add water 1\/4 cup at a time until you reach desired consistency. Even better tasting the second day!&#34;","120":"&#34;This spooky soup is great to eat before going trick-or-treating.&#34;","121":"&#34;This spicy and satisfying chili is made in the slow cooker.

Chili lovers should enjoy this very much. Sprinkle with Colby Jack cheese, which melts well and doesn't get stringy.&#34;","129":"&#34;Loaded with ground beef and Polish sausage, red wine, tomatoes, bell pepper, and as spicy as you like it... Made this way, it has a serious bite!&#34;","130":"&#34;This makes a very thick chili. For a thinner chili, omit the tomato paste. For a chili soup, omit tomato paste and sauce and use 1 can (16 ounces) tomatoes with liquid and add 1\/2 cup water and 1 beef bouillon cube.&#34;","131":"&#34;This recipe is one that I have made several times now. It is very tasty and nutritious. It is a little spicy. Can serve with corn bread or over pasta topped with Cheddar cheese.&#34;","132":"&#34;Delicious white chicken chili! Make on stove top or let it simmer all day in slow cooker.&#34;","133":"&#34;Black bean veggie chili, richly spiced, can be ready for dinner or game day in only 30 minutes.&#34;","134":"&#34;Chocolate, Guinness&#174; extra stout beer, and spicy sausage are the signature ingredients in this beef and bean chili.&#34;","135":"&#34;This is a delicious and exotic alternative to American-style chili. It's not too spicy, but combines intriguing flavors. I adapted this recipe from a traditional Afghani family favorite. It may be cooked in a slow cooker, Dutch oven, or soup pot. Try it also with ground lamb or ground turkey.&#34;","136":"&#34;A chili using no meat, eggs or dairy products.  Tastes great in a bread bowl and is easy to make!  This soup should never be made the same way twice!  Add red, green or yellow bell peppers in the first step, experiment with the beans, or add whatever your heart desires.

For a non-veggie dish, add 1 lb ground beef and some sour cream.&#34;","137":"&#34;Spices permeate the entire dish - cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper - and hominy adds an authentic Southwestern accent to this chicken chili. Save a big chunk of time simply by using rotisserie chickens from the supermarket and canned chicken broth as the chili base.&#34;","138":"&#34;Enjoy the flavor of Buffalo chicken recreated in this hearty black bean chili.&#34;","139":"&#34;This easy chili is unique and delicious. It has the added bonuses of iron, vitamin A, and protein.

Ground turkey may be substituted for ground beef.&#34;","141":"&#34;I love a spicy and thick chili during fall and winter months; this recipe (made with ground turkey) kicks butt! The cocoa powder is the secret ingredient! Works best to have all your ingredients chopped drained and ready before you start, as it thickens up pretty fast over the heat.&#34;","142":"&#34;Vegetarian chili with quinoa. Sprinkle cheese on top to serve.&#34;","143":"&#34;The pumpkin is a great surprise in this chili! It makes the whole house smell good and tastes great! Garnish with cheese and jalapenos if desired.

They do, in this satisfying vegetarian chili.&#34;","147":"&#34;A very spicy chili that tastes oh so good.  Serve on top of hot cooked spaghetti.&#34;","148":"&#34;This is the chili recipe the gang eats at Purdue Boilermaker football games. I always prep and cook the chili the night before and then reheat the next day. This is a combination of many different tomato-based chili recipes. Good luck and enjoy.&#34;","149":"&#34;This Texas-style chili (no beans) has been a hit with family and friends. It originated as a Michigan State tailgating dish, to keep warm during cold football Saturdays (with help from my Texas cousin). As always, you can tweak recipe to adjust heat and consistency. Top with sharp Cheddar cheese, sour cream, diced fresh sweet onions, and tortilla chips. Enjoy!&#34;","150":"&#34;I was going to attempt a chili recipe I got from a friend and discovered I had none of the ingredients.

My kids ate this on their hot dogs, and, before I knew, it the entire pot was gone.&#34;","155":"&#34;This is the chili I make for Super Bowl (and many other occasions). I developed the recipe over about a five year period, and it is a huge hit with my friends. The 'secret' ingredients include Thai fish sauce, lime, and whiskey. This recipe takes a long time with multiple steps. You can braise and shred the beef and make the sauce on separate days, and it's definitely better the next day. Garnish with sweet onion, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Serve over rice, beans, or pasta.&#34;","156":"&#34;Golden brown, slightly sweet cornbread waffles perfectly complement the rich, smoky flavor of beef brisket chili. Serve chili on top of cornbread waffles; top with shredded cheddar cheese and chopped onions. I use fat-free cheese and also some sour cream on mine. This stuff is seriously delicious, so make sure to buy two boxes of cornbread.&#34;","157":"&#34;This is an easy slow cooker meal - use your imagination and season it up as you like! Great on a c-c-c-cold winter night! I serve this with grated cheese, sour cream, chopped cilantro and green onions, and flour tortillas on the side.&#34;","158":"&#34;This is a recipe given to me by a good friend and co-worker. It has a wonderful flavor that I think anyone can appreciate, especially for a quick fix on a cold winter day! Serve with jasmine rice as side with chili or fresh French or Italian bread.&#34;","159":"&#34;Paleo (eating like our pre-agricultural revolution ancestors ate) chili is made without beans. In the west we typically include beans, but I think even non-paleo eaters will enjoy this deep smoky flavorful chili. This is best made a day ahead so the flavors can meld together. Serve with green onions and sour cream.&#34;","160":"&#34;Made a chicken chili recipe, and it was bland. So I took the ingredients and added my own flair. My family loves it when it gets cold out, because they know this will be on the menu. It's very flavorful. Serve with tortilla chips and sliced avocado for something different. Serve with sour cream and cheese.&#34;","161":"&#34;This is a great chili recipe for your slow cooker. It allows you to spice it up as hot as you can take it. Oh, and let's not forget the garlic, eh!&#34;","162":"&#34;After browsing through many, many chili recipes, I ended up creating one of my own.&#34;","163":"&#34;The chipotle peppers give this slow cooker chili a subtle, smoky flavor. Add more minced chipotle peppers to taste. Serve with sour cream, sharp Cheddar cheese, and chopped fresh cilantro.&#34;","164":"&#34;Meat won't be missed in this thick, hearty chili.  It is great for a weeknight, only 20 minutes from start to finish!  This quick chili recipe is a great option for tailgating with vegetarian friends.&#34;","165":"&#34;Can be made on the stove or in the slow cooker. It's quick, easy and so good.&#34;","166":"&#34;Chili made with ground beef, beef stew and chili beans. Adjust the seasonings to suit your taste.&#34;","167":"&#34;This is a long-standing favorite recipe evolved to suit the slow cooker and minimal messing around. Chop vegetables, brown meat, throw it all in, and walk away.&#34;","168":"&#34;Easy recipe with little preparation time. This can also be made with ground turkey, and it tastes even better the next day!&#34;","169":"&#34;Chili is always a little bit of experimentation, a whole lot of flavor, and one of my absolute favorite dishes. There is always a little give and take but here is my honed recipe with the (staple) list of ingredients. Serve in a bowl on a cold night or even spread over white or brown rice sometimes. Always sprinkle generously with Cheddar cheese and crumbled tortilla chips and maybe a dollop of sour cream and enjoy!&#34;","170":"&#34;This chili was made for school chili suppers back in the 1950's. I remember in the third and fourth grades, the teachers would have each student draw on poster board a bowl of chili and crackers. The posters were then used to advertise the coming event. This recipe comes from our neighbor who worked in the school cafeteria.&#34;","171":"&#34;This is my family recipe. It's great for kids, potlucks, and it's really flexible. Hope you all enjoy! I would add 1\/2 to 1 cup of water to the chili after all the other ingredients to make it a little more like soup. If your kids absolutely do not like spicy things, you could add sour cream and cheese to it. Serve with corn chips or corn bread.&#34;","172":"&#34;This is a very zesty and hearty chili recipe loaded with vegetables. Garnish with sour cream and cheese, if desired, and serve with herb toast.&#34;","173":"&#34;This is such a great and filling recipe, you hardly notice it's good for you!&#34;","174":"&#34;Chili served over ziti pasta.&#34;","175":"&#34;An unusual chili, with cinnamon, cloves, and even chocolate!&#34;","176":"&#34;This chili recipe is many years in the making and I have won several awards with it. I think you'll be pleased with it. You can alter it to your own spice levels to achieve your perfect chili. Garnish with shredded mozzarella cheese, and use corn chips for dipping.&#34;","177":"&#34;I never knew what I was missing until my mother-in-law made this! Everyone begged her for the recipe. A nice and easy way to feed a crowd. Thanks to my mother-in-law this has become a favorite dish!  Can be frozen very well and doubled for a larger crowd.  Top with your favorite shredded cheese.&#34;","178":"&#34;This recipe can be made in a slow cooker, or on the stove top. White corn chips and shredded Jack cheese complete the meal. This is a nice low fat meal.&#34;","179":"&#34;This is a chili I have been making for years. I have made it with all kinds of ground meats (beef, turkey, deer, elk) but I prefer ground moose. The longer you let it simmer the better as the flavors will blend. Top with shredded cheddar cheese. Serve with fresh baked cornbread and sweet honey butter. Men LOVE this meal!&#34;","180":"&#34;This is an easy recipe similar to chili-mac but made with spaghetti. My son loved it and thought it was a neat concept. He even wanted it for breakfast the next day!&#34;","181":"&#34;I served mine with some beautifully ripe slices of avocado that gives the final bowl another layer of silky richness. By the way, don't let the cocoa powder in our chili spice mixture throw you off! It's only a small amount and it really works. My chili was garnished with sour cream, diced jalapeno, cilantro and avocado.&#34;","182":"&#34;If you love heat, this chili is for you. I've taken a combination of a few of my favorite chili recipes and added my own personal touches to create a very flavorful, spicy chili. You can also sub dried basil and oregano for fresh, and bacon bits for crumbles; fresh is always a better flavor though. The longer it simmers, the better it tastes. Serve in bowls with Cheddar cheese and sour cream topping. Goes well with cornbread.&#34;","183":"&#34;There's nothing like a steamy hot bowl of chili on a cold snowy day. What's even better is having it ready within 35 minutes from start to finish.&#34;","184":"&#34;A simple version of white chili that can be made on the stove top or in a slow cooker. This is our go-to chili for those chilly winter days. Cook on Low in a slow cooker for 4 hours if preferred. Serve with garlic cheese bread. Enjoy.&#34;","185":"&#34;A really good chili sauce like I had as a kid. This took me many years to get the ingredients just right. Hope you enjoy.&#34;","186":"&#34;A twist on classic chili with fresh veggies and lots of seafood, seasoned with chili and lime and lots of garlic.&#34;","187":"&#34;Tasty chili whose name says it all! Note: Whole Anaheim peppers are not widely available; this ingredient is optional, and you can use hot pepper sauce instead.&#34;","188":"&#34;Makes 10-15 servings. This recipe can be adjusted according to your taste preferences, so you can leave out undesirable ingredients or add others that appeal to you (like mushrooms). I add ingredients just to bulk up the heartiness and color palate of the chili, but feel free to just use a few green peppers or same-colored zucchinis as you desire.  By the end, you just want everything to be hearty, moist, and flavored -- mess around with it as you go! I would say to serve it with shredded cheese and corn chips, but then it's no longer 'vegan.'  : )&#34;","189":"&#34;Great quick recipe for a rainy night. Serve with low-fat sour cream and shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese for topping.&#34;","190":"&#34;This is our home made deer chili recipe. We eat venison whenever possible as it is healthier than beef. This is a great chili to serve at parties and to get friends that think they don't like venison to try it out. They will be greatly surprised! Enjoy!&#34;","191":"&#34;Chocolate and lamb in chili? Of Course!!!  This is a wonderful chili recipe, concocted by my son Bryan.  We use Icelandic lamb because it is really lean.  Lean lamb is a must.&#34;","192":"&#34;My mother gave me this one as an easy way to dump dinner in a pot and be done with it. It is a simple meal. Serve with crackers or cornbread.&#34;","193":"&#34;You can make this chili in about half-an-hour using ground beef and ground sausage cooked with canned kidney beans, corn, and chili seasoning.&#34;","194":"&#34;Beef, chili beans, and a special surprise ingredient give this chili a savory flavor unrivaled by other chilis. Serve topped with diced raw onion, sour cream, and shredded Cheddar cheese for a mouth-watering delight! Believe it or not, the secret is the ketchup (NOT catsup) that adds just the right flavor to the sauce; use more or less as desired. Use sauteed fresh mushrooms for a special treat! Seasonings may be added to taste. If you want it really hot, use hot chili beans and add more chili powder and cayenne pepper or include hot peppers!&#34;","195":"&#34;A spicy but flavorful chili recipe. Trust me, you won't miss the meat!  We love to pair this with one of favorite microbrews.&#34;","196":"&#34;This chili hits the spot a cold night!&#34;","197":"&#34;Super spicy chili con carne!  Serve over spaghetti or some other type of pasta, topped with shredded Colby cheese and additional chopped onions if desired.   This comes out almost black in color and is VERY HOT!&#34;","198":"&#34;A thick, meaty chili with a little kick. This killer recipe is easy although has a bit of extra prep because of all the meats in it. You can adjust the heat temperature based on how much fresh habanero you add.&#34;","199":"&#34;A hearty chili with a little kick and a German twist.&#34;","200":"&#34;Beef chili soup, packed with flavor is delicious over rice and topped with cheese or sour cream. Great for company, camping, and freezing. Serve soup over rice. Top soup with sour cream, Monterey Jack cheese, and tortilla chips if desired.&#34;","201":"&#34;This one-skillet chili mac is on the table in less than half an hour, and it's loaded with family favorite flavors.&#34;","202":"&#34;A rich and delicious chili soup with many layers of flavors, that does not include tomatoes, pepper skins or seeds, but packs plenty of heat.  Adjust seasoning to your own taste, and serve with cheese if desired.&#34;","203":"&#34;Paleo-friendly chili to be served over cilantro-lime cauliflower rice.&#34;","204":"&#34;Delicious chili with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers, carrots, corn, and several kinds of beans. Great as a snack or as a whole meal. Can feed an army or keep for days. Serve with a sprinkling of cheese. You may also add a 12 ounce package of vegetarian burger crumbles after the ingredients come to a boil.&#34;","205":"&#34;This is a lovely variation of chicken chili. More a bean soup with chicken and chili seasonings.&#34;","206":"&#34;Favorite family chili recipe, handed down to me by my mother.&#34;","207":"&#34;This soup is so yummy on a cold day.&#34;","208":"&#34;This is just the best tasting chili.  My family prefers it over beef chili.  I like to put out toppings such as chopped onion, cilantro, chopped bell pepper, cheese, and sour cream and let everyone serve themselves.&#34;","209":"&#34;This is so incredibly easy, and I have made it numerous times. I love making this for freezer meals and passing it along to my friends with new babies. This makes a great freezer meal; you can add all ingredients into a freezer bag before or after cooking and freeze.&#34;","210":"&#34;This Recipe can easily be multiplied and freezes well.&#34;","211":"&#34;This is a great and simple chili, full of flavor, and plenty of spice.  It's best when refrigerated overnight and reheated before the game. One tip: season meat heavily with chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper while browning. &#34;","212":"&#34;Ground turkey is simmered with bell peppers, garlic, tomatoes, kidney and pinto beans, jalapenos, chili powder, and onions in this easy chili. Add chopped onions, cheese, and crackers, if desired, to top it off before you eat. Enjoy.&#34;","213":"&#34;Lentils are cooked in a flavorful chili along with carrots and celery.&#34;","214":"&#34;Quick and easy with little fuss. I used to spend a lot of time simmering and seasoning and this tastes the same! Serve with shredded cheddar on top and a loaf of French or Italian bread. Salad on the side and you have a meal! &#34;","215":"&#34;This is an excellent chili recipe for game meats. You can easily substitute venison with buffalo or boar as well.&#34;","216":"&#34;This colorful recipe is a modified version of my mom's chili that I grew up on. It is called 4 way because of the four steps to making your plate: spaghetti first, then crushed crackers, next cheese, and finally the chili. I added the peppers, but the recipe is still great (and faster) without them. To heat things up, just add hot sausage and\/or hot chili seasoning packs instead of mild. It is an off-beat recipe that I am sure you will love!&#34;","217":"&#34;Spicy beef, onion, and beer chili recipe I picked up while in Alabama. Many people have asked me for the recipe so I'm posting it here. Enjoy! Adjust the amount of jalapenos and other spicy things to suit your taste.&#34;","218":"&#34;This chili is so easy and very tasty.&#34;","219":"&#34;The first time I tried this chili I was floored! It has wonderful flavors, and is very spicy and very addictive. If you don't like heat, adjust the ingredients. It's perfect at a football tailgate party or picnic. If you like a roasted flavor, bake the garlic before pressing it. For the beer, a hoppy pale ale works well, as does a dark stout. I've also experimented with adding a cup of coffee to the mix to give it a roasted coffee flavor. It also freezes well.&#34;","220":"&#34;The foods in this easy recipe are powerhouses of nutrition. Why this recipe is good for you: High antioxidants in tomatoes, corn and beans; High fiber in beans; Low in fat (20% of calories from fat); Beans help suppress blood sugar rises and may help combat diabetes and heart disease.&#34;","221":"&#34;This is a wonderful chili recipe that I have used to win chili cook-offs in Indiana. It's hearty and spicy award winning chili that is sure to hit the spot on a cold winter's night. The key is in using name brand tomato soup, I have tried it with others but haven't gotten the same results. Your friends will never guess the secret ingredient. Enjoy!&#34;","222":"&#34;A culinary experience with a blend of spices and just the right flavor of down-home Texas goodness. Jalapenos may be added for a little more spice.&#34;","223":"&#34;The extra step of roasting the sweet potatoes really concentrates the sweet, earthy flavors and gives the starchy chunks a marvelously meaty texture.&#34;","224":"&#34;This delicious recipe is a snap to make and tastes delicious! It's vegan and vegetarian, but for those who like cheese, you can serve it topped with cheese, with crackers on the side.&#34;","225":"&#34;Good chili from the great ol' state of TEXAS. Hope you enjoy this favorite of our family.&#34;","226":"&#34;You have never had chili like this before!  I am always being asked to make it for football games or just anytime friends and family get together!  It is a compilation of many recipes I have tried over the years. Betcha' you've never had chili like this before!&#34;","227":"&#34;I'm on a constant quest to provide lean but still delicious food for my family. This is my most recent take on chili. Top with your favorite garnishes, or enjoy as is!&#34;","228":"&#34;I have been working on this chili recipe for years now.  I think it's almost there.  It is involved but worth the experience.  Serve in a bowl topped with cheese or as a dip with corn chips.  Enjoy.&#34;","229":"&#34;Thick and spicy chili. Coffee and beer give this chili a unique and dynamite flavor. Garnish with shredded cheese and diced chile peppers.&#34;","230":"&#34;This is the best chili recipe ever! My friend Kelly taught me how to make it, hence the name. My younger brother loves this recipe so much he makes me make it every two weeks.&#34;","231":"&#34;This chili is a healthier version of your traditional chili. But don't let the idea of healthy scare you away! This chili packs in the fresh flavors of peppers, cumin, and cilantro all combined into one amazing dish. Or as my fiancee would describe it, 'super-good'. Have fun with this recipe. Spice it up or simmer it down. Just have fun in the kitchen!&#34;","232":"&#34;Vegetarian chili created for cold Chicago-land Fridays in Lent. Good by itself or served on rice or noodles, with crusty bread or cornbread, and topped with sour cream and\/or Cheddar cheese.&#34;","233":"&#34;A light, spicy soup that is great in any season. I hope you enjoy this recipe; my family sure does! For spicier tastes, add more cayenne or your favorite hot sauce. Serve with crackers, cheddar cheese, or sour cream.&#34;","234":"&#34;The coconut, curry, and mango chutney really put the flavor in this one. I put this together one night with what I had, and loved the results. It tastes better the next day, just like most chili. This freezes well. Seriously, you have to try it.  Serve by itself, with rice, and\/or with naan bread.&#34;","235":"&#34;Throw summer's fresh vegetables into a pot and stew them up for an antioxidant-packed, Southwestern-flavored treat. Black beans also have fiber, folic acid and cholesterol-lowering activity.&#34;","236":"&#34;I wanted to make a delicious Crockpot&#174; chili that didn't take an hour to prepare. This one, you just open cans and dump them in! You can let this cook all day or it's ready after a couple of hours.&#34;","237":"&#34;A combination between white chili and jerk chicken.  Use milder chiles to prevent it from being too hot. Serve over corn or tortilla chips and add sour cream if desired.&#34;","238":"&#34;This chili has great flavor with medium heat. It's best when made the day before, refrigerated overnight, and then reheated over medium heat until it begins to simmer again.&#34;","239":"&#34;Given to me by a close friend and is pretty much amazing. Even better heated up the next day.&#34;","240":"&#34;This chili earned its blue ribbon at a chili cook-off three years in a row! It is a mild, sweet chili, but it could always be spiced up with a little hot sauce. In Wisconsin, chili has macaroni noodles in it, which my husband thinks is the best part of this recipe. Enjoy! Add canned kidney beans with the macaroni, if desired.&#34;","241":"&#34;Garlic- and herb-seasoned pork loin is simmered with beans, potatoes, corn, and green chiles for a crowd-pleasing, warming bowl of chili.&#34;","242":"&#34;My grandmother used to care for the Masons. Mr. Mason was a pioneer in the roadside food industry. He owned cafes in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas that served chili and apple pie. He kept his chili recipe secret for decades. He lived to be 107 years old, and my grandma finally got his recipe.&#34;","243":"&#34;This chili contains no onions, beans or tomatoes. It is even better the next day. Season to your tastes as it may be too spicy for you. You can also add pinto beans, sour cream and lime juice, if desired.&#34;","244":"&#34;Created from memory of a recipe I once used, this is the best chili I've ever made. It makes a hearty, healthy, and flavorful chili. Difficult to tell that beef was not used. Top as desired with cheese, sour cream, jalapenos, etc.&#34;","245":"&#34;This recipe has been used by me for several years, but keeps getting changed just a bit every time depending on what is in the pantry and freezer.  If you prefer poultry instead of pork, substitute 1 pound ground chicken or turkey for the ground pork.&#34;","246":"&#34;This is an old family recipe that my mom has cooked for 50 years. It's a  wonderful, 'stick-to-the-ribs' meal that goes wonderful with warm cornbread or rolls. I find that kids love this when they don't like regular 'spicy' chili. Enjoy!&#34;","247":"&#34;Ready in less than 30 minutes, this gluten-free one-skillet dish is the perfect family dinner for busy weeknights.&#34;","248":"&#34;Easy chili recipe for a large number of people.&#34;","249":"&#34;I call this my accident chili because I tried to find a great chili recipe and couldn't, so I just started adding things and by accident it was great. If you are looking for a sweet or spicy recipe this is not it. This is just a traditional good recipe.&#34;","250":"&#34;This has ground turkey, salsa, corn, great Northern beans and jalapeno pepper-jack cheese. I requested this recipe from my co-worker after she brought it into one of our many potlucks. It is very tasty and a little spicy; if you don't like it spicy, cut the amount of cheese in half--it will still have a little kick! This recipe is really easy, and even the pickiest eaters will love it.&#34;","251":"&#34;This is my personal recipe, and it has won over 12 chili cook-offs, and I figured I'd share. It is a medium steak and bean chili. If I had to compare it, it would be similar to Steak N' Shake's chili, but better! It's rather involved, but trust me. Worth every minute! Try it. You will not be disappointed!  &#34;","252":"&#34;From the beautiful union of three meats and three chiles comes a chili that will never let you down - thank the heavens and feel the heat! This is best served with sour cream, cheese, cornbread, and something to cool your mouth off (beer).&#34;","253":"&#34;Easy and delicious chili recipe.&#34;","254":"&#34;Using some fresh and some canned ingredients, this chili is a snap to throw together and will keep you craving it for days. Chunky zucchini, fresh green onion, sour cream, and - what the heck - shredded Cheddar cheese, are sure to make this your favorite chili recipe. If you like beans in your chili, garbanzos right out of the can are great in this.&#34;","255":"&#34;Thick chili made with black beans, tomatoes, ground turkey, corn, and spices. Quick and easy. Perfect for a cool day. Serve with hot jasmine rice. Adjust the amount of black beans as desired.&#34;","256":"&#34;A favorite at hunting camp. This is a quick, one pot meal using ground beef, beans and rice. Serve with crushed red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce on the side for individual tastes.&#34;","257":"&#34;Four types of beans are combined with red pepper flakes, lots of cumin, chili powder, and salsa in this fiery turkey chili.&#34;","258":"&#34;I looked at the top 5 recipes on this site, combined my favorite ingredients from each, plus a few of my own (Sriracha&#174;\/adobe sauce) and...ta-da! A meaty, spicy, flavorful, turkey chili! \n\nYou can quickly cook up the turkey and combine ingredients in slow cooker, throw in the fridge, and take it out to cook on low before you go to work - works perfectly, easy peasy! \n\nAll the guys love it for football games, tailgating, and just plain old cold weather. \n\nFrom my table to yours, hope you enjoy! Serve with sour cream and cheese to your liking.&#34;","259":"&#34;Great chili recipe for a very large crowd.  Cook it in a 6 gallon steam jacketed kettle or a huge pot on the stove.&#34;","260":"&#34;This chili is delicious. Add whatever amount of seasonings your family enjoys, and also add extra vegetables like zucchini and carrots if you want. Please make and enjoy -- I know you will!&#34;","261":"&#34;Tasty white chili that can be made with turkey or chicken. Jalapeno peppers give just enough kick! Garnish with green onions, cilantro, more cheese, or chopped tomatoes. &#34;","262":"&#34;This chili is slightly sweet with a touch of heat; the wine gives it a different taste. Everyone in my family loves this chili. I've won a couple of work chili cook-offs with this recipe and done well in some larger cook-offs as well.&#34;","263":"&#34;The husband and I love chili, and love it spicy! But cooking for 3 little children requires me to tone it down for their taste buds. We like to add a few dashes of Sriracha&#174; or fresh chopped jalapeno and onion to make up for the missing heat. The kids are partial to goldfish crackers on top! But as with any chili, feel free to top it with your favorites. If you are lucky enough to live near an Italian market, the salsiccia is best in our opinion. If not, then you can sub another kind of ground Italian sausage. It may be light on spice, but full of flavor!&#34;","264":"&#34;This version won our chili cookoff at work a few years ago in the non-traditional category. Once the weather turns cool, this is one of the first things we make! Also great for a group.&#34;","265":"&#34;I cook by intuition and my intuition led me to this amazing chili that is presented for you here. It's quick, super-easy, and delicious! Wear gloves when handling serrano peppers. Save the seeds; you can use them in a pepper oil. Also, you don't want to taste the oregano. The goal is for it to just sit atop the tomato flavor. Similarly with the cinnamon.  The curry was a lucky accident, but it worked! Don't add too much of it though or it will turn your chili an unappetizing orange. Like any chili, this one is great with shredded cheese and sour cream.&#34;","266":"&#34;Hearty veggie chili-soup that's quick, easy, and delicious.&#34;","267":"&#34;Easy to make, great anytime, and always a favorite.&#34;","268":"&#34;This is my grandmother's recipe for chili and the only one I make for my family now since we all love it so much. This recipe is great after it has sat overnight in the fridge as well. The flavors blend nicely over time. Garnish with shredded cheese or other ingredients to you're liking.&#34;","269":"&#34;Our Dad's chili is great!  Good for kids who don't like spicy foods.  They will love this flavorful dish. And, it's easy!  In fact, I teach my kids' friends how to make it.&#34;","270":"&#34;Fred is German and I am Texan!  This creation is a blend of the two!  Have a different ethnic background?  You can easily add spices and other ingredients to make it your own, although, we have to say - it's quite good the way it is. This can  easily be prepared the day before or put into the freezer for later use. Serve over baked potato or corn chips with &#8216;fixins' such as sour cream, grated cheese, onions, etc.  For a richer flavor, you are able to make this dish the night before and keep in refrigerator until the next day. Enjoy! \n&#34;","271":"&#34;This is a great dish that takes no time at all. It can be made without the meat and it still tastes great. Great for potlucks!  When dished out, add sour cream to thicken and add hot pepper sauce for zip!&#34;","272":"&#34;This is a rich, mild chili and pork stew. It is one of my favorite things, which I like to eat from a bowl with plenty of saltine crackers and a salad on the side. It's also good served over rice or chili beans.&#34;","273":"&#34;A combination of ground beef and pork is simmered with tomatoes, pinto beans, bell peppers, and onion in this meaty chili.&#34;","274":"&#34;I love making chili in the fall and snuggling up under a blanket on the couch with loved ones while we eat chili, corn bread, and watch the beloved Broncos! Serve with yummy sweet corn bread.&#34;","275":"&#34;So bold, even a meat eater wont care that it's meatless!&#34;","276":"&#34;This is a hybrid of two chili recipes and it is wonderful. I serve it with tortilla chips and cheese. Makes great nachos!!&#34;","277":"&#34;A great hearty option for a hungry appetite, our Chili Blanco recipe blends together a great potato soup recipe with green chilies, white beans, chicken and cheese. Experiment with garnishes to make this recipe your own.&#34;","278":"&#34;Many years ago, while visiting a friend in Idaho, we decided to make chili and wandered into the grocery store with a vague idea of what chili was supposed to have in it.  Several slight adjustments later, this was the result and it has become a family standard.&#34;","279":"&#34;This is one of the best, easiest, and tastiest vegetarian chili recipes I've ever tasted. Whenever I make it, my friends devour it. Best eaten with tortilla chips, Cheddar cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. What a treat! The recipe creator's name is Doc Meromorphic. He is a good friend of my family.&#34;","280":"&#34;People who have tasted this thick mix of beans, spices and chicken say: 'So good it'll make you perky and stupid!' I've placed in my workplace's annual Halloween chili cook-off for the last three years.  Looks strange -- tastes great! Serve with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and warm flour tortillas.&#34;","281":"&#34;In just 30 minutes, you can indulge in our Fix-It-Fast Chili soup recipe. Ground beef is delicately mixed with spices, beans and veggies for a quick and satisfying bite.&#34;","282":"&#34;When I need a healthy, easy dinner for the family, I get out my slow cooker and make this chili. Chicken, cannellini beans, and salsa verde make this a delicious and somewhat spicy dish. Serve with shredded cheese and tortilla chips.&#34;","283":"&#34;Ground turkey, stewed tomatoes, and four kinds of beans make this chili quick, light, and flavorful. It's great served in bowls and sprinkled with cheese for a fall lunch or supper.&#34;","284":"&#34;Contrary to the title, it doesn't have men in it. However it is a man's best friend, it's thick, not as tomato-ey as most chili's. Best served with fresh bread.&#34;","285":"&#34;Just an easy slow cooker chili recipe I came up with. Can be varied very easily with different ingredients. Serve with corn muffins and a simple tossed salad for an easy dinner.&#34;","286":"&#34;A delicious, Mexican-inspired green pork chili.  When garnished with fresh tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, and tortilla chips this is a hearty meal with a tangy and spicy finish.&#34;","287":"&#34;This beef chili recipe brings forward the flavors of cinnamon and chocolate often found in Mole Poblano style sauces. It really creates some depth and complexity in a otherwise fairly traditional chili recipe. This recipe is an award winning recipe that is a frequent crowd favorite.&#34;","288":"&#34;I threw this together on a cold day when I was itching for some chili. The spice measurements are approximate. I start out with 1\/8 cup and go from there.  It cooks up fast and gets better when stored in the fridge and reheated. Top with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream, if desired. Enjoy!&#34;","289":"&#34;When it comes to tailgate foods, chili is a classic dish that is perfect for football weather.  Our recipe for a hearty beef chili can be prepared in a slow cooker, meaning that it's easy to prepare, store and transport.  And best of all, with a Reynolds&#8482; Slow Cooker liner, cleaning up at your next tailgate will be easier than ever.&#34;","290":"&#34;Quick-cooking barley and pre-cooked chicken makes this pot of chili quick, thick, and comforting. I am going to serve it with Cheddar cornbread. Serve with what ever toppings you might like. I used stock that I made from the picked chicken that I used for the chili. Made it that much richer.&#34;","291":"&#34;Don't be afraid to try this chili,  the ingredients create a tasty chili sensation!  For a different taste, try substituting the 6 ounces of cola with 6 ounce of prepared coffee.  Prepare this the day before serving in order to let the flavor heighten.  Enjoy!&#34;","292":"&#34;A hearty chili, made with tons of veggies and extra lean ground pork.&#34;","293":"&#34;I was served this dish at a friend's home when we lived in West Virginia.  She was from Ohio.  I love this dish and serve it often. Note: End result should have consistency of spaghetti sauce.&#34;","294":"&#34;For those of you not from the Philadelphia area, 'whiz wit' it how we order our cheesesteaks (meaning Cheez Whiz&#174; with onions). This is a recipe I came up with combining two of my favorite foods, the cheesesteak and chili. This is a great recipe to make for parties or the big game. Throw it in a slow cooker to keep warm, and it feeds an army.&#34;","295":"&#34;A hearty chili that is perfect for a big crowd, or freeze part of it for an easy weeknight dinner another time.&#34;","296":"&#34;My unique chili recipe starts each bite with a somewhat-sweet ginger overtone which then melds into a full bodied chile spice. This recipe is the stove-top version but it can easily be done in slow cooker as well (starting with step 4).&#34;","297":"&#34;A spicy chili if you want it to be, depending on how much chili and curry powder you add.  Not your typical chili. Best if left to cool and then reheated. Serve with brown rice.&#34;","298":"&#34;This hearty chili is sure to warm up appetites.&#34;","299":"&#34;Modified from various recipes for our tastes - sized to fit my 3 quart slow cooker. Serve with sour cream, shredded cheese, and cornbread or corn chips or fresh fried corn tortillas. Melt Velveeta&#174; into leftovers for an instant-win dip.&#34;","300":"&#34;This is a hearty and relatively low-fat chili recipe that is guaranteed to satisfy even the most sadistic spicy food lover...REAL MAN FOOD. (For those with wimpier taste buds, omit the Habanero pepper). Try melting a tablespoon of whipped cream cheese into each dish. Hoo boy! Also, drink beer with lime. The acidity seems to help calm the assault on your taste buds when it gets to be too much.&#34;","301":"&#34;Easy to make and ready in just 30 minutes.\u00a0 Butternut squash\u00a0adds a twist of sweetness to this chili.&#34;","302":"&#34;If you are entertaining mixed palates, this meal will satisfy all tastes. A from-scratch chili that uses many different vegetables as well as beans, lentils and tofu to provide that 'full' feeling that chili with meat offers. Add fresh parsley and basil to taste, if desired. I prefer to let the chili sit overnight in the refrigerator before serving.&#34;","303":"&#34;Chicken breast, onion, chile peppers and beans make for great white chili sustenance! Here is a good recipe for those cold nights. Serve with some crusty French bread and a salad. Season to your own taste (some might like it spicier.)&#34;","304":"&#34;Green chili is a Colorado favorite, it's always a crowd pleaser when we have out-of-state visitors.  Roasting your veggies first gives this recipe a deeper level of flavor. This can be served over rice as a main course, stuffed in enchiladas, or over potatoes and eggs.&#34;","305":"&#34;Quick and easy soup with lots of veggies and original tastes with the pineapple and pumpkin. Serve with hot corn tortillas to eat on the side. There are lots of other ingredients that can be switched in and out. Switch coconut milk out for regular milk or skip the milk altogether. Other options include adding green beans, asparagus, or chicken. Enjoy!&#34;","306":"&#34;I have several very good chili recipes, none of which I ever seem to have all the ingredients on hand for! This recipe came about one night through a mish mash of all the recipes, and now it's the only one I'll make! Turned out perfect, and SO easy!&#34;","307":"&#34;This chili is so easy to make and is so good!  Trust me.  To make a double batch, double everything except the meat and onion.  Use 1 can each of pinto and kidney beans, that is how I normally make it.&#34;","308":"&#34;I always get rave reviews about this recipe when I serve it to friends and family.  I know everyone always says their chili is &#34;the best&#34;, but this one truly is.  Don't just take my word for it --  try it!&#34;","309":"&#34;A hearty version of chili with steak instead of hamburger.&#34;","310":"&#34;This a recipe I came up with after getting a few ideas from a friend. The combination of chipotle and cilantro really complete this chili.&#34;","311":"&#34;Great Southwest twist to traditional chili.&#34;","312":"&#34;A fairly simple and quick chili recipe!&#34;","313":"&#34;This is a no-fail recipe for chili that is made all in the same pot! Great to freeze and have for later on as well! I make this in a large amount and separate it up and freeze it.&#34;","314":"&#34;A spicy Texas-style chili: no beans, tomatoes or ground beef. Great on a cold winter day and goes especially well with Golden Sweet Cornbread (which can also be found on Allrecipes). If you don't want to use beer in the chili, simply replace it with the same amount of water.&#34;","315":"&#34;Cinnamon, cocoa powder, and chili powder are the surprisingly complementary flavors in this easy chili and rice dinner.&#34;","316":"&#34;So tasty and filling, you won't miss the beef! It's a great dish for a crisp fall day or during a winter snow storm. This recipe is easy too, anyone can do this one!&#34;","317":"&#34;Very good chili, sometime I make a little rice on the side to serve in the bowl with the chili.  Delicious.&#34;","318":"&#34;This stew beef chili beats ground meat chili 10x all day.\n\n Once you take the time to do this, you'll wonder why you didn't discover this classic sooner. How you serve this chili will determine how long it lasts.&#34;","319":"&#34;This chili recipe is tested. Hope you enjoy it!&#34;","320":"&#34;A quick yet tasty chili,  in which you can lower the fat by using ground turkey instead of ground beef.&#34;","321":"&#34;This is a low-fat, high-protein recipe. For vegan, simply leave out the cheese. The variety of beans adds a nice touch of color, and it can be made as mild or spicy as you like it. Remember to recycle all those cans we used.&#34;","322":"&#34;A thick and hearty homemade chili with a kick. If you like a thinner chili, add another can of tomato sauce. Serve topped with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheddar and buttery crackers. You can't stop at just one bowl!&#34;","323":"&#34;Chunks of white meat chicken, Great Northern beans, salsa, and Pepper Jack cheese make this a super simple and super quick recipe sure to please everyone! Serve with tortilla chips and sour cream.&#34;","324":"&#34;This chili recipe can be used as either lunch or dinner on low-carb days served without cheese or bread.&#34;","325":"&#34;What happens when you have a Japanese friend that likes chili?  You make him wasabi chili.&#34;","326":"&#34;This quick chili recipe is great in the summertime or winter. It's also great for potlucks and family gatherings. It tastes great with a spoonful of sour cream.&#34;","327":"&#34;A very tasty, somewhat spicy, variation of chili that uses chicken. I like to serve it with sweet corn bread.&#34;","328":"&#34;There is a vast difference between the chili you cook and serve on its own and the chili that you slap on a chili dog.  The texture and taste have to compliment the dog using smaller amounts so it won't explode all over your face. This chili is our perfect double-dog-dare-you chili for use on hot dogs. Yes, they are hot dogs, not franks. Franks lived in France from the third to the fifth century on the banks of the Rhine River. If you must call them something other than hot dogs, try 'weinahs,' that works for us in the north.&#34;","329":"&#34;If you like spicy and hot you will love this. It will make you say 'yum yum'!&#34;","330":"&#34;When you ask someone why they don't use a pressure cooker, one of the most common replies is something to the effect of: I'm really not into being killed by an exploding stew. The marvels of pressurized heat are actually very simple!&#34;","331":"&#34;Best chili concoction this side of the Rio Grande!  Not for the faint of heart.&#34;","332":"&#34;A delicious alternative to traditional chili, made with pork loin, wild rice, white beans, and authentic Mexican red chile. Make it easily in a slow cooker.&#34;","333":"&#34;A true fusion of 'Tex' and 'Mex' style chili. I've made this recipe dozens of times, and it is great.  Each bite slowly delivers a sweet flavor followed by dry heat afterwards.  It takes a while to prepare, but well worth it. You can use any type of beans you like, and try different dried chile varieties.&#34;","334":"&#34;Smoky flavors in bacon, pork filet, and paprika bring depth to this rich chili with white beans and fire-roasted tomatoes.&#34;","335":"&#34;My mother was given this recipe by a friend years ago.  I've made it for many occasions...perfect for Super Bowl parties (Go Rams!) or taking to work. I have yet to prepare it without getting multiple requests for the recipe.  It's a great recipe to freeze or make ahead -- it tastes great the second day!&#34;","336":"&#34;This is a wonderful low-fat zesty turkey chili finished with a fat-free Cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt Baja sauce. Serve with your favorite cornbread recipe.&#34;","337":"&#34;A super delicious chili which can be made vegetarian by excluding the ground beef.  With its unique texture and sweet savory flavor with a hint of spice, this recipe will have your friends asking for seconds!&#34;","338":"&#34;With creamy chicken corn chowder and black beans, this flavorful chicken chili verde is ready to eat in less than half an hour.&#34;","339":"&#34;This a very hearty and spicy chili, one I believe all will love!  Serve topped with Cheddar cheese.&#34;","340":"&#34;My Daddy, 'born and bred' in Texas, came up with this recipe and the name for it.  It took some convincing, but I got him to allow me to share the recipe.  We love it and hope you do to. Enjoy!!&#34;","341":"&#34;Not for the faint of heart.  This hearty chili strives to excite all the taste buds.  Each bite is at first sweet, and then 'blossoms' into a slow burn that begs for the next bite. Use coarsely sliced jalapeno, so that the less adventuresome can easily identify and scoop them out. Serve with fresh grated sharp process white Cheddar and warm garlic bread.  Serve leftovers on hot dogs - yes, beans and all.&#34;","342":"&#34;While chili snobs will argue over what true chili really is, you'll be enjoying this amazing recipe that brings together many well-loved (if hotly debated) chili ingredients.  The Johnsonville Italian Sausage gives the dish an extra boost of flavor and heat that will make all chili fans want more.&#34;","343":"&#34;This recipe is something I will whip together on nights when spaghetti just won't cut it, but time is a commodity worth more than gold. There are only two in my family, but that just means plenty of yummy leftovers. Serve this chili with cheese on top and a thick slice of homemade sourdough bread and you've got a winner. The measurements are approximations since I'm more of a shake and dab type of cook, but this is generally right. This gives more kick than you might think, so be lenient with the pepper flakes if you are serving kids!&#34;","344":"&#34;This chili was created on a snowing Carolina Day. It takes a little time but it worth the wait!  We add peppers, too -- we like it hot!&#34;","345":"&#34;Adapted from an old recipe my mother used for family gatherings. Because you make it in a Crock Pot&#174; it is easy to transport to a party. It's flavorful and I promise everyone will ask for this recipe.&#34;","346":"&#34;This is a great recipe for a quick four ingredient chili for those cold nights when the kids have hockey or any sport and you have to run around! Of course, adding cheese and onions if you have time will enhance this meal, as will saltine crackers. Enjoy!&#34;","347":"&#34;If you like spicy food like me, you will enjoy this chili; it's not for the faint of heart.&#34;","348":"&#34;This hearty white chili with chicken, seasoned rice, cannellini beans, veggies and more is ready to serve in 30 minutes.&#34;","349":"&#34;This is a simple crowd pleasing recipe that can sit in a slow cooker until it is time to serve.&#34;","350":"&#34;This is a basic recipe for non-traditional chili using steak. My wife is allergic to chili powder, so I don't use any in this recipe, but you are welcome to add some if you like. This is a very tame, full-flavor, colorful chili recipe that even the kids will like. There are plenty of other variations that you can use with this basic recipe, please change at will. Things we have tried include adding three or four fresh jalapenos, or adding Tabasco&#174; habanaro sauce, or cilantro, or fresh tomatoes, or using red, yellow, orange, and green peppers, or hamburger instead of a steak or roast. Serve with tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream.&#34;","351":"&#34;This is a very simple and hearty chili with plenty of flavor. It's even better the second day! I serve this with lowfat Cheddar cheese and lowfat sour cream. It's also delicious with crackers.&#34;","352":"&#34;Not your average chili. Because this is a chili and not a stew or soup, it is deliberately under-watered. I would add 1 cup of water if you are planning on leaving the house while this cooks, especially on High. And if you are using frozen chicken, allow an extra hour to reach the correct consistency. Also, you may need to add salt depending on how salty the broth you are using is. If you like your chili spicier, I would add a lot more jalapenos. I think I used about 3 tablespoons on a half recipe of this. For a more intense cumin flavor, use cumin seeds instead or add the cumin at the end.&#34;","353":"&#34;A Super Bowl favorite that has the bite of a hungry gator.&#34;","354":"&#34;My hometown has a pumpkin festival every year and this is one of the recipes our family enjoys.&#34;","355":"&#34;Super delicious, super easy. The baked beans are what makes this chili perfect!&#34;","356":"&#34;This recipe omits the beans for a paleo style chili! You can follow directions on stove top or grill top. Feel free to substitute whatever type of meat you'd like to use!&#34;","357":"&#34;This is so easy and so tasty. Freezes great for meals later in the week. If you want it a little thinner add an extra can of tomato sauce. Also the green chiles are not hot but add a wonderful flavor, so don't be afraid of them.&#34;","358":"&#34;Multi-colored vegetables make this chili delicious and pretty! Serve with cornbread for a great fall dinner.&#34;","359":"&#34;This sweet and mild chili features lean ground pork with a few surprises. Serve with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce to taste. This chili is very mild as is.&#34;","360":"&#34;A Caribbean twist to a great winter-time dish!  Sure to get the sinuses flowing!! This can be prepared without meat - just omit the steps with ground beef. Serve this dish by itself or over a bowl of basmati rice.&#34;","361":"&#34;I experimented with tofu one night because I didn't have ground beef on hand. This makes a lot but stores really well in the fridge to be reheated! Definitely good for those who are weary to try tofu.&#34;","362":"&#34;Here's a hearty chili made with ground beef and kidney beans, cooked for hours in a slow cooker.&#34;","363":"&#34;Break out your soup pot and fix up a batch of this delicious, spicy vegetarian chili today! It's ready in no time, and packed with vegetables, beans - and flavor!&#34;","364":"&#34;This delicious recipe is for the slow cooker.&#34;","365":"&#34;A family favorite vamp of chili from Grandma Cheryl! You MUST use a large cast-iron pan, or chili will not thicken as fast or as much! Can sub chicken breast for turkey cutlets. Jalapenos and hot sausage are optional, but add the most flavor if you're not scared of a little spice!&#34;","366":"&#34;I love a hearty beef chili as much as the next guy, but once in a while there's nothing wrong with going over to the light side and enjoying an equally comforting bowl of white bean and chicken chili.&#34;","367":"&#34;My Aunt Jerre won THIRD PLACE with this recipe in the St. Louis Slow Cooker Cook Off in the past couple months!  We are proud, proud, proud!&#34;","368":"&#34;A chili that is best when prepared with fresh vegetables, but still delicious with canned or frozen. Serve by itself or over rice.&#34;","369":"&#34;I like chili, but I'm not a fan of heat for heat's sake. I wanted something that would warm me up but not be overwhelmingly hot, and this was the result. My husband says that this would also make a good sloppy joe (with beans) mix.&#34;","370":"&#34;This easy, filling meal uses lots of fresh vegetables, and some frozen or canned to make it easy. Ground turkey breast can be added for meat lovers. Serve over wild rice with shredded cheddar cheese, or with tortilla chips.\n&#34;","371":"&#34;Something old, something new! This quick, new-age chili has become quite the favorite in our house! Sure to be a crowd pleaser! Garnish with cheese, onion, sour cream, avocado, etc.&#34;","372":"&#34;Serve a simple bowl of chili and guests will be content. Zip in fun, colorful condiments and you've got a party. The chili yields about 5 quarts without the beans, and may be cooled, covered, and refrigerated or up to 3 days and reheated when ready to serve.&#34;","373":"&#34;Hearty, with just a touch of spice. Got this from my co-worker who got it from her physical trainer. This chili won in our chili competition at work.&#34;","374":"&#34;Make this easy and surprisingly hearty chili with ground chicken or turkey. Simmer 3 hours on stove top, or 8 hours in a slow cooker on Low (3 hours on High).&#34;","375":"&#34;I won a chili cook-off with this recipe in Tennessee in 1996. My family and friends all love this chili. It is requested for all family get-togethers. Great dish for a chilly day. Serve with shredded cheese and crackers.&#34;","376":"&#34;Great recipe. It makes a lot but my family likes it so much there is never any left over. It's great on a cold night. It is my brother's recipe; he ran his own campground for awhile.&#34;","377":"&#34;This recipe was given to me by a friend. It's very good. Garnish with sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, minced jalapeno peppers, and fresh cilantro.&#34;","378":"&#34;This is an easy to make departure from your traditional chili.  This recipe calls for pepperoni, mushrooms and a jar of prepared spaghetti sauce.  Every time I make this for others, I am always asked for the recipe.&#34;","379":"&#34;This is a ground beef and pork and bean casserole that my mom used to make.  It has a BBQ flavor to it.  My kids ask for it twice a week!! Serve with cornbread or brown bread.&#34;","380":"&#34;This was handed down to me by Mom, a Cincinnati native. Skimming the fat makes this a healthier version than most, and gives it the right consistency.  I like mine 4-way, with spaghetti, raw chopped onions, grated mild cheddar, and oyster crackers!&#34;","381":"&#34;This is a spicy but flavorful chili made with meat! Children may want to eat something else for dinner because this is just too spicy!  Dollop some sour cream on top when serving to soften the blow to your tastebuds when you experience my chili masterpiece!&#34;","382":"&#34;This chili is super quick to prepare, and is ready in less than an hour. Garnish with cheese.&#34;","383":"&#34;This recipe is a long-time favorite in my house. It's quick to make and is very healthy. The adobo chili is a must. You can find them in a small can in the Mexican food aisle of most grocery stores. This chili freezes well, so double the recipe if you want.&#34;","384":"&#34;The slow cooker is a great way to make chili. This beefy chili is packed with beans, veggies, and spice.&#34;","385":"&#34;Quick and easy chicken chili for the whole family. Serve plain or over rice. Top with tortilla strips, shredded cheese, sour cream, plain yogurt, and\/or green onions. Could also be served over tortilla chips for a great nacho dish. Red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, or chili seasoning mix can also be used to season.&#34;","386":"&#34;Serve with corn bread and salad. If you cube the chicken ahead of time, make corn bread muffins while preparing the chili, and use a bagged salad mix from the produce department, this is a very fast meal to put together.&#34;","387":"&#34;A delicious slow cooker chili with so many spices and so much flavor!!&#34;","388":"&#34;Ground lamb and black bean chili made with Fat Tire&#174; beer.&#34;","389":"&#34;Ground beef, a tomato base, pinto beans, and a variety of spices are combined to make a fiery hot chili that is perfect for a cold winter's day.  The key to the heat is in the cayenne pepper so adjust to your individual taste.  Double the recipe to make a crowd pleasing addition to your next football watching party. Serve with some shredded Cheddar cheese and fresh chopped onion, if desired.\n&#34;","390":"&#34;The best thick hearty chili recipe you'll ever need. In 25 years of restaurant cooking, this is my classic chili recipe; loved by thousands. Vary the amount of green chilies and hot sauce if you're an Easterner unused to fiery Western foods, but don't change anything else.&#34;","391":"&#34;This simple and quick one-pot chili has great flavor and is nice and meaty.&#34;","392":"&#34;Peanut butter, mango chutney and lime juice - in chili?! Yes, and it's delicious! This incredibly quick and easy - yet quite nontraditional - chili is a perfect antidote to fancy holiday meals and works equally well using chopped leftover turkey. 'Eat it again, Sam'!&#34;","393":"&#34;A long-time Wellington, Ohio friend shared this recipe with me and has become an all-time favorite. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and salsa. You can brown the chicken in a skillet first if you prefer. I have found it makes little difference.&#34;","394":"&#34;A simple but tasty chili recipe using ground elk meat as the base. Best served with Mexican style cornbread. Beef may also be substituted for elk.&#34;","395":"&#34;Hearty three-bean chili with vegetables. \nServed with thick slices of garlic bread, it's a Grey Cup party staple.&#34;","396":"&#34;I have searched far and wide for a recipe that compares to Goldstar or Skyline chili, to no avail. Finally, I took a number of decent recipes and blended them together with the help of a former Goldstar Chili employee. It's still not the same, but it feeds my cravings. The most important things about the chili is how you prepare the beef and the cinnamon and chocolate. I recommend refrigerating the chili overnight. It always tastes better the next day.&#34;","397":"&#34;A great alternative to regular chili. This dish has a unique taste that even the pickiest eater will enjoy. Make sure you spice this one to taste! Garnish with cheese, salsa, sour cream and cilantro leaves, and serve with rolled tortillas on the side.&#34;","398":"&#34;A delectable, southern winter dish that warms the heart and fills the tummy! Garnish with chopped avocado if desired.&#34;","399":"&#34;This recipe dates back to 1946. It has  the right combination of water, flour, broth, and spices to create a thick, tomatoless chili con carne.&#34;","400":"&#34;A simple chili recipe with three types of beans, turkey, diced tomatoes, spices and a touch of sweetness. This thick and rich chili recipe will surely be added to your regular dinner menu.&#34;","401":"&#34;The slow cooker does all the work for this savory soup.&#34;","402":"&#34;Perfect for people who love using their slow cookers. I've tried many chili recipes but this one is the best ever! You can substitute beans for the cornmeal, but I think it takes away from the taste and the smooth texture. I recommend opening a second bottle of porter beer and drink it while cooking this tasty dish! Yum!&#34;","403":"&#34;This recipe won the Blum invitational chili cook-off\/Super Bowl&#174; party. It really is good. Many people say this but this one guarantees an empty pot when taken to potlucks. I got this recipe from my friend Mark, who has spent his life in public safety positions. He hasn't forgotten his firehouse roots as evidenced by this recipe.&#34;","404":"&#34;This is a nice way to have the flavour of chili without always using red meat. This can also be served as a filling for tacos!&#34;","405":"&#34;A very yummy and healthy meal that tastes like it should be bad for you. I use hot chili seasoning. Enjoy.&#34;","406":"&#34;This chili was a fun experiment that my kids gave 5 stars! Rhubarb is very popular in desserts and should make an appearance in a main dish occasionally. Serve with your favorite chili toppings, or eat on its own.&#34;","407":"&#34;This is my personal chili recipe, I really like it and hope you do too.&#34;","408":"&#34;This is a Texas style chili recipe with beans. It also uses hamburger rather than chuck. Leaving behind a small amount of the hamburger fat gives it that unique Texas chili taste.&#34;","409":"&#34;An awesome change from the traditional beef chili! I made this for my husband for the first time and he went back for seconds!&#34;","410":"&#34;I've been making this recipe for the family for many years. It's a great winter time warm up and makes a meal in itself.&#34;","411":"&#34;Got 30 minutes and a craving for good chili? Then get out your saucepan, because this chicken chili really satisfies.&#34;","412":"&#34;This is a wonderfully filling (high protein) yet yummy 3-bean, gluten-free, and vegetarian chili. I like to serve this chili over gluten-free macaroni and top it with shredded cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt.&#34;","413":"&#34;Beef and pork sirloin rubbed with many seasonings, marinated, then simmered with tomato, onion, garlic, salsa and the right bite of jalapeno chile peppers. Come on, ice cream! The best chili I have ever tasted. My cousin Chuck's recipe. The secret is in the meat seasoning! A must for any chili lover!&#34;","414":"&#34;This zesty white bean chili with chopped smoked sausage is ready to serve in 20 minutes.&#34;","415":"&#34;This recipe will feed a crowd!  Serve with grated cheese, sour cream, salsa, and chopped onion.&#34;","416":"&#34;A bold twist to a traditional favorite. This recipe would have even pleased Stalin.&#34;","417":"&#34;Best chili ever! My husband and I created this recipe after making several other chili recipes, we selected the best from each and voila! And it is so colorful and inviting!&#34;","418":"&#34;Easy chili with beans can be made as mild or spicy as desired. It's even better the next day.&#34;","419":"&#34;Being in Texas, chili is a staple on the few cold days we have each year. This is something I've come up with after years of trying to perfect an easy-to-make and delicious chili. This is a very spicy chili and the perfect meal for a chilly day. The beans are optional here as they traditionally aren't found in Texas chili.&#34;","420":"&#34;This recipe was passed down from a friend, and now it is one of our favorites!  It's great to make whenever there is left over chicken or turkey around!  We pray for colder weather in California just so we can make this soup!  You can substitute additional diced tomatoes for the tomatillos. If you would like the soup to be spicier, you can add some red chili flakes or salsa. Serve with these toppings for people to choose from: limes, cilantro,  cheese, avocado, sour cream, and tortilla chips.&#34;","421":"&#34;Spaghetti topped with hot chili - it's got all the food groups!&#34;","422":"&#34;This is a hearty chicken chili with sweet pineapple and a few subtle kicks of spice that the whole family will enjoy.&#34;","423":"&#34;Spicy jalapeno chicken sausage gives this chili heat and a rich savory flavor.&#34;","424":"&#34;A quick and easy, hearty chili for cold days and sporting events. Add your favorite toppings and enjoy.&#34;","425":"&#34;My friend Keni's love of smokey chipotle peppers inspired this recipe. It comes together perfectly and is a unique chili that will stand out against others. It is a spicy chili that at the same time is mellow. It gives you the kick without the lingering burn like many chilis do.&#34;"},"fat":{"0":"17.5g","1":"3.6g","2":"21.1g","3":"18.7g","4":"53.8g","5":"14g","6":"16.6g","7":"11.7g","8":"6.1g","9":"27.2g","10":"11.6g","11":"7.2g","12":"8.6g","13":"10.3g","14":"31.2g","15":"24g","16":"12.7g","17":"15g","18":"33.8g","19":"10.6g","20":"14.9g","21":"17.6g","22":"19g","23":"15.1g","24":"14.9g","25":"16.2g","26":"9.2g","27":"4.4g","28":"11.5g","29":"6.1g","30":"4.4g","31":"10.8g","32":"2.8g","33":"3.5g","34":"7.3g","35":"3g","36":"5.9g","37":"15.4g","38":"8.5g","39":"13.5g","40":"16.3g","41":"20.4g","42":"1.4g","43":"12.2g","44":"63.1g","45":"3.8g","46":"19.6g","47":"13.9g","48":"10.8g","49":"32.2g","50":"16.8g","51":"18.5g","52":"8.6g","53":"8.8g","54":"30.1g","55":"13.9g","56":"21.4g","57":"71.6g","58":"14g","59":"14.7g","60":"12.8g","61":"5.7g","62":"15.1g","63":"56.4g","64":"18.9g","65":"7.6g","66":"43.9g","67":"16.8g","68":"6.7g","69":"18.5g","70":"10g","71":"37g","72":"20.3g","73":"20.7g","74":"9.1g","75":"19.8g","76":"21.2g","77":"21.1g","78":"7.3g","79":"12.7g","80":"5.4g","81":"27.8g","82":"22.3g","83":"6.5g","84":"4g","85":"16.1g","86":"40.9g","87":"26.7g","88":"14.6g","89":"15.1g","90":"18.2g","91":"7.4g","92":"14.8g","93":"7.7g","94":"22g","95":"31.6g","96":"5.4g","97":"13g","98":"14.4g","99":"8.2g","100":"31.1g","101":"20.6g","102":"14.4g","103":"7.6g","104":"12.2g","105":"31.1g","106":"5.5g","107":"10.2g","108":"16.7g","109":"14.8g","110":"9.3g","111":"37.7g","112":"54.2g","113":"14.8g","114":"10.5g","115":"60.8g","116":"6.8g","117":"3.1g","118":"14.2g","119":"22.1g","120":"4.7g","121":"13.8g","122":"18.8g","123":"32.4g","124":"4.9g","125":"21.7g","126":"17.9g","127":"19.4g","128":"35.1g","129":"22.1g","130":"24.6g","131":"6.6g","132":"7.3g","133":"4.8g","134":"25.6g","135":"20.7g","136":"2.4g","137":"25g","138":"8.4g","139":"2.4g","140":"12.7g","141":"17.1g","142":"3.5g","143":"6.4g","144":"5.1g","145":"3.3g","146":"16.1g","147":"29g","148":"30.1g","149":"26.8g","150":"29.3g","151":"7.7g","152":"11.2g","153":"4.8g","154":"27.2g","155":"11.9g","156":"22.9g","157":"2.3g","158":"11.6g","159":"17.2g","160":"2.9g","161":"12.5g","162":"11.2g","163":"24.9g","164":"1.2g","165":"13.7g","166":"12.8g","167":"14.4g","168":"11g","169":"16.7g","170":"6.1g","171":"5.5g","172":"2.4g","173":"7.2g","174":"23.7g","175":"35g","176":"27.2g","177":"9.2g","178":"10.3g","179":"3g","180":"18.7g","181":"18.9g","182":"12.1g","183":"14.9g","184":"6.5g","185":"9.4g","186":"8g","187":"31.9g","188":"2.4g","189":"5g","190":"18g","191":"16.4g","192":"18.6g","193":"29.5g","194":"10.7g","195":"10g","196":"16.3g","197":"58.1g","198":"21.3g","199":"26.8g","200":"14.7g","201":"22.7g","202":"12.7g","203":"25.2g","204":"1.8g","205":"4.8g","206":"6.5g","207":"1.1g","208":"5.8g","209":"10.3g","210":"19.3g","211":"24.5g","212":"7.7g","213":"3.1g","214":"18.6g","215":"36.9g","216":"23.8g","217":"14.2g","218":"16.6g","219":"29.5g","220":"6.3g","221":"13.3g","222":"8.3g","223":"14.7g","224":"4.6g","225":"21.7g","226":"36.1g","227":"11.9g","228":"26.6g","229":"16.1g","230":"6.9g","231":"9.6g","232":"4.7g","233":"6.6g","234":"9.7g","235":"5.8g","236":"11.8g","237":"29.6g","238":"11.6g","239":"15.5g","240":"14.7g","241":"9.9g","242":"31.2g","243":"37g","244":"10.2g","245":"25g","246":"22.4g","247":"4.6g","248":"26.3g","249":"7.5g","250":"18.6g","251":"10.8g","252":"40.7g","253":"23.2g","254":"31.9g","255":"18.3g","256":"32.7g","257":"8.8g","258":"9.9g","259":"11.9g","260":"9.6g","261":"13.8g","262":"13.5g","263":"19.3g","264":"4.2g","265":"3.4g","266":"16.2g","267":"19.9g","268":"10g","269":"24.7g","270":"21.1g","271":"7g","272":"33g","273":"25.5g","274":"14.2g","275":"2.9g","276":"11.6g","277":"2.2g","278":"11.8g","279":"18.2g","280":"4.1g","281":"10g","282":"7g","283":"5.6g","284":"27.6g","285":"21.4g","286":"22.6g","287":"20.7g","288":"12g","289":"17g","290":"7.5g","291":"16.8g","292":"10.6g","293":"23g","294":"34.5g","295":"23.9g","296":"19.6g","297":"0.8g","298":"40.6g","299":"5.6g","300":"13.9g","301":"17.2g","302":"1.6g","303":"11.1g","304":"12g","305":"16.5g","306":"19g","307":"13.3g","308":"23.1g","309":"28.3g","310":"8.5g","311":"4.7g","312":"7.9g","313":"15.6g","314":"49.1g","315":"15.3g","316":"19.9g","317":"7.3g","318":"12g","319":"6.4g","320":"25.1g","321":"15.6g","322":"31.8g","323":"12.1g","324":"4.4g","325":"24.6g","326":"5.8g","327":"13.9g","328":"14.8g","329":"21.4g","330":"25.3g","331":"18.1g","332":"13.4g","333":"67.7g","334":"19.5g","335":"16.4g","336":"15.9g","337":"11.5g","338":"14.1g","339":"3.7g","340":"38.1g","341":"32.2g","342":"41g","343":"8.2g","344":"18.1g","345":"7.9g","346":"11.6g","347":"19.3g","348":"13.7g","349":"2g","350":"7.9g","351":"6.1g","352":"12.9g","353":"7.4g","354":"16.4g","355":"10g","356":"26.4g","357":"5.2g","358":"5g","359":"20.1g","360":"8.1g","361":"5.1g","362":"17.7g","363":"7.9g","364":"28.1g","365":"22.9g","366":"8.9g","367":"2.8g","368":"2.8g","369":"4.4g","370":"5.3g","371":"4.9g","372":"26.5g","373":"4.7g","374":"4.7g","375":"14.3g","376":"24g","377":"20.5g",
